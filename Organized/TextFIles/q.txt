3.how do you handle challenging situations?

In challenging situations, I first try to calm myself and 
take a moment to think clearly. I look at the issue from
different angles to understand it better.

Then, I like to create a plan of action that includes both 
short-term and long-term steps to solve the problem 
effectively.
